# typora-theme-mediumlike
## A Medium-inspired Typora theme.

I created this theme for Typora in an afternoon because I like the editing interface of Medium so much I wanted to use it elsewhere too. Medium uses paid fonts, now I obviously did not pay for them, but tried to choose something similar.

### Installation:
1. Open Typora
2. Open preferences
3. Click on 'Open Theme Folder'
4. Copy all the files to the theme folder
5. Restart Typora

There is a light and a dark version, similarly to how you can turn on night mode on Medium. To achieve the same editing effects you can use in Medium I did the following:
- The first # Title is the same as the Medium title. The rest of # Titles are, thus, smaller in font-size.
- The first ## Title is the same as the Medium subtitle. The rest of ## Titles are, thus, different in font-size and colour.
- To achieve the first type of quotation from Medium, use > Quotation.
- To achieve the second type of quotation from Medium I sacrificed highlights: use ==Quotation==.
- The divider *** had been changed to resemble Medium's 'insert a new part'.

Have fun writing!
